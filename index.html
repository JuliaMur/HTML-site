        <p id = "about">"A long time ago, when the little girl Julia was still in school, she dreamed of becoming a programmer. But her parents had their own plans, and they sent her to study economics. After 5 years of university and 6 years of work, Julia moved from her country to Finland and started to live the life she wanted."</p>
        <p>Hi everyone! I am happy to see you reading my small essey about my long way to become a developer. I started my journey by learning basic things in Java. At the time, everything seemed very complicated and unintelligible to me. Over time I began to understand more, and my knowledge of Java helped me understand the basic concept of other languages. 
            During my studies at Omnia vocational school, I learned a little bit of PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.
        <p> One of my global goals is to create a full-fledged website for an animal shelter to help homeless cats and dogs find their homes and owners. </p>
